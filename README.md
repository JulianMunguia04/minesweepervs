## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Features and Gameplay üïπÔ∏è

### MinesweeperVs
MinesweeperVs is a real-time competitive multiplayer game built with Next.js and React on the frontend and Node.js on the backend. Real-time gameplay and player synchronization are powered by Socket.IO, game state and ephemeral data are cached in Redis for low-latency updates, and persistent user & match data are stored in PostgreSQL.

### üîê Sign Up and Login
Users can sign up or log in using either their email and username or Google authentication. Passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt before being stored in the PostgreSQL database to ensure data protection.
Upon successful login, the server generates a JWT (JSON Web Token), which is stored client-side and used to maintain a secure session ‚Äî allowing users to stay logged in and authenticated across the app.

### üßæ Account
Users can view their match history, track performance stats, and monitor their ELO ranking over time. All player data and match results are stored in PostgreSQL, while frequently accessed stats are cached in Redis for faster load times.

### üë• Social
Users can add friends, send messages, and challenge each other to matches. Friend data and chat history are stored securely in PostgreSQL, while active chats and online presence are managed through Redis for real-time updates and low latency.

### ‚öîÔ∏è Matchmaking
Players can search for a game through the Redis matchmaking queue, which pairs them against other available players in real time. Alternatively, they can invite friends directly to a private match. Redis handles active match sessions and player status, ensuring smooth and instant connections.
